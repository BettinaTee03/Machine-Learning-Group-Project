To activate the .yml file follow below
In terminal or PowerShell copy the following commands

conda env create -f mlpro.yml

conda activate mlpro

The first line will create the venv in order to have a dedicated venv that is the same across all our computers
The second line will activate the venv in order to run the program with all the required dependanceis that we are using ex pandas, numpy ect.

Be sure to activate the second command any time that you want to run the program! (its basically a python kernel)
